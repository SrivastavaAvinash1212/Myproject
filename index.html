          In order to perform well in life, our body needs energy. We get this
          energy from the food we eat. Without food, there will be no life. In
          today’s world, there are so many dishes available worldwide. Indian
          dishes comprise of Biryani, Dosa, Paneer Masala and more. Similarly,
          we have western foods like pizza, pasta, noodles and more dominating

          Like me many people love to eat pizza disrespect of their age. Pizza
          was a basic part of the Italiand diet and was originated from Italy.
          The world’s 1st pizzeria was opened in 1738 in Naples (Italy). Pizzas
          are now revolutionarized to tomato sauce from just plain dough into
          four in one pizzas. Today you can buy 4 different kinds of flavors by
          paying only for one pizza. Isn’t yummy??

            At times when we are in a hurry, hamburgers are one of the easiest
            foods to eat while on the go. No matter what time it is whether its
            breakfast, lunch, or dinner we grab a hamburger and might throw in
            some fries and a soda to go with it. Many restaurants are known to
            make their hamburgers in a specific way. Preparation differs from
            restaurant to restaurant. But what really makes a hamburger taste so
            delicious? Depending where you go they will taste different but they
            are all structured the same.

            A drink (or beverage) is a liquid intended for human consumption. In
            addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play
            important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include
            plain drinking water, milk, juice and soft drinks. Traditionally
            warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated
            drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history.

            French fries (North American English), chips (British English),
            finger chips (Indian English), French-fried potatoes, or simply
            fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating
            from either Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting the
            potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually in a
            deep fryer. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet
            potatoes.
